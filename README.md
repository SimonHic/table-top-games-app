# Table-Top-Games-App

This project is for my Software Development Module Assignment 3.

## What does this App allow you to do?

    This console based app allows you to do multiple things such as:
    
   - Store and Create table-top games (e.g: board games, floor games etc)
   - Mark them as played or not
   - Listing options to display if they are played or not, or have been marked how many stars out of 5.
